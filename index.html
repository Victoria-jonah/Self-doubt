    <h2> What Is <span> Self-Doubt?</span></h2>
    
    <p class="p1"> <span>Self-Doubt</span> is a lack of confidence regarding yourself and your abilities. It's a mindset that holds you back from succeeding and believing in yourself.

      <h2> Ways To Overcome <span>Self-Doubt</span></h2>
      
      <h3 class="h3"> 1. Practice Self-Compassion</h3>
        
      <p class="p2">
        <span>Self-doubt</span> means that you're holding yourself back. It arises from the fear of making a mistake, but mistakes are how we grow and improve our abilities. Look at yourself in the mirror and say three positive affirmations at the beginning of everyday. Say things like "I love every part of me", "I am unique", "I recognize that my worth is not in the hands of external sources". And watch how you'll become more confident everyday.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="h3"> 2. Think Back To Your Past Achievements</h3>
      
      <p class="p3">
        Many of us have a mindset that thinking about your past is basically just the bad memories full of mistakes, No!, You can also think about the good ones. Self-reflection is a fantastic tool, it reminds us that we're capable of what we want to achieve. But living in the past can take you away from the present moment. Learning from what happened-and not dwelling on the bad-and focusing on using the lessons you've learned from thoses times to improve the present is what truly matters.

      <h3 class="h3"> 3. Try Not To Compare Yourself To Others</h3>
      
      <p class="p4">
        <span>Self-doubt</span> can also arise when you measure yourself up against a family member, colleague or even a celebrity. Everyone's life is different, and someone else excelling doesn't mean you don't have any strengths. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on yourself. It's one of the best ways to stay happy and accomplish your dream. My mentor once said "People Don't Post Their Failures Or Loss" so don't loose your balance or self-confidence when viewing people's post or status online.

      Williams Shakespeare once said "Our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good we oft might win, by fearing to attempt". Basically, that means doubts makes us quit. Embrace your self-confidence once again.Thanks for reading.</p>
